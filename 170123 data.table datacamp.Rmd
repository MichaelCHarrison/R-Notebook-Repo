Learning how to use data.table through datacamp.com

General form of a data.table query:

3 parts to query as read in R - i, j, by; read as select from DT all rows where mpg >20, and of those select average horse power and minimum weight, grouping the rows by cylinder and whether the cars have 5 gears or not.

We can read this as take DT, subset rows using i, then calculate j group by by

** Can translate to SQL in which i = where, j = select, by = group by


```{r}
mtcarsDT <- data.table(mtcars)

mtcarsDT[
        mpg > 20,
        .(AvgHP = mean(hp),
          "MinWT(kg)" = min(wt*453.6)),
        by = .(cyl, under5gears = gear < 5)
]
```
